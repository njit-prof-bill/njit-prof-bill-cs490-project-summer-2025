My name is Marcus Talbot, and Iâ€™ve been working in backend development for over 5 years. 
I specialize in Python and Django and have built scalable APIs for e-commerce platforms.
 Most recently, I led a team of engineers at a logistics startup. 
 I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Georgia Tech.
