Dr. Priya Narayanan is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washington, focusing on computational neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces. 
She earned her PhD from MIT, where her dissertation involved machine learning models for decoding motor signals from neural activity. 
She has published over 15 peer-reviewed papers and presented at NeurIPS, ICML, and SFN. 
Priya has received research grants from the NSF and DARPA, and collaborated with interdisciplinary teams including electrical engineers, 
cognitive scientists, and clinicians. She also teaches undergraduate neuroscience and mentors PhD candidates in their research. 
Her long-term goal is to translate neural decoding technologies into accessible assistive devices for patients with paralysis.
