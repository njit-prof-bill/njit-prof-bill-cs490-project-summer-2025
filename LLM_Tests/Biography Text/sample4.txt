As a designer and UX researcher, I’ve spent the past 7 years helping brands understand their users. 
My name is Nina Patel, and I graduated from SCAD with a degree in Interactive Design. 
I’ve worked with startups and agencies, including IDEO and Figma, focusing on accessibility and mobile-first design.
