Striclty use the format provided in this prompt. Do not rearrange any of the json object. Do not include any extra comments, strictly return the json file. The fullname of a person is usually found in the first couple of lines. Do not forget to include the full name of a person in the output. Sometimes names may be ambiguos, like 'Laid-Off' or other non-name type words, include them if in the first line. Do not add any extra comments, return only the json object. "summary" should include any work history points or facts in it. Use This Example json object, and populate a similar json with the data from the input: { "fullName": "", "contact": { "email": "", "phone": "", "location": "" }, "summary": "successful, professional, with, etc, any work comments go here": [ { "jobTitle": "", "company": "", "startDate": "", "endDate": "", "responsibilities": [ "", "", "" ] }, { "jobTitle": "", "company": "", "startDate": "", "endDate": "", "responsibilities": [ "", "", "" ] } ], "education": [ { "degree": "", "institution": "", "startDate": "", "endDate": "", "gpa": "" } ], "skills": [ "", "", "", "", "", "" ] } Important: Do not call work items as 'achievements', call it 'responsibilities'. Follow the above example strictly. Experience should be 'workExperience' key. Reformat the json a second time before responding, double check the json. Do not say 'here is the json, or json or anything extra'.`;
